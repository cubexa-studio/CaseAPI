# CaseAPI

![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.0.0-blue)

CaseAPI is a lightweight API designed to integrate seamlessly with the CaseOpening plugin. It allows other plugins to interact with cases, track statistics, and extend functionality.

**Note**: This API requires the CaseOpening plugin to be installed and running.

## üîß Installation

### **Maven**
```xml
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>jitpack.io</id>
        <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>

<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.cubexa-studio</groupId>
    <artifactId>CaseAPI</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
```

### **Gradle (Kotlin DSL)**
```kotlin
repositories {
    maven("https://jitpack.io")
}

dependencies {
    compileOnly("com.github.cubexa-studio:CaseAPI:1.0.0")
}
```

## üöÄ Getting Started

### **1. Hook into CaseAPI**
Before using the API, you need to obtain an instance of `CaseAPI`. This can be done using the Bukkit Services Manager:

```java
private CaseAPI caseAPI;

@Override
public void onEnable() {
    RegisteredServiceProvider<CaseAPI> provider = Bukkit.getServicesManager().getRegistration(CaseAPI.class);
    if (provider != null) {
        caseAPI = provider.getProvider();
    }
}
```

### **2. Add the Plugin as a Dependency**
To ensure your plugin loads after CaseOpening, you need to declare it as a (soft-)dependency in your plugin.yml:

```yaml
depend: [CaseOpening]
```

This ensures that the CaseAPI is available during your plugin‚Äôs `onEnable()` phase.

### **3. Listening to Case Events**
You can listen to CaseOpening events to trigger custom actions. To do this, you first need to create a `CaseOpeningEventListener`:

```java
public class MyListener implements CaseOpeningEventListener {
    
    @Override
    public void onCaseOpen(CaseOpenEvent event) { }
    
    @Override
    public void onCaseOpenComplete(CaseOpenCompleteEvent event) { }
    
    @Override
    public void onFailedCaseOpen(FailedCaseOpenEvent event) { }
    
    @Override
    public void onCaseRewardAnnounce(CaseRewardAnnounceEvent event) { }
}
```

If you don't want to listen for certain events, simply leave the method empty.

Now you just need to register the `CaseOpeningEventListener`. This can be done via the `CaseAPI`:

```java
caseAPI.registerListener(new MyListener());
```
